Find code chunks that require update, given a refactor task.

Input:

1.  HVM3's chunked codebase snapshot hvm3-chunked-codebase-snapshot-29-12-2024.txt,
    (truncated to ca. 10%)
2.  Summary of hvm3-chunked-codebase-snapshot-29-12-2024.txt

Your output message:

1. Summarize the code refactor request,
2. bring your summary into relationship to the codebase
3. Describe what regexes are useful for finding chunks that require update.
