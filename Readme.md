# Concept

Say what chunks of a code base are required to update, given a refactor request in natural language. 
See [bounty](https://gist.github.com/VictorTaelin/23862a856250036f44fb8c5900fb796e)


# Run

- pull this repository

## 1. Anthropic api key

- Either set an environment variable `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`,
- or modify [this script](./secrets/api-key.sh) to output the api key

## 2. With Java


```
java -jar dist/chunk-analyser-0.0.1-standalone.jar "Fix todos"
```

## Or With Babashka

[See babashka](https://github.com/babashka/babashka)


```
bb -x bennischwerdtner.refactor.analyser/say-relevant-refactor-chunks --request "Fix todos"
```

# Concepts

This uses Anthropic public api, asking model to output regex patterns. 

They are then used to filter the chunks. 

The initial prompt is made from some summary and a portion of the input code base as example.


# Build

- `bb build`, which see

# Time

Seems to be 5-10s.

# Cost

tldr: 0.02-0.03 USD per code refactor request

- It makes a single claude sonet api call per code refactor request

- input prompt is ca 7200 tokens.
- output is max 1024 but probably way less so let's say 400

- Claude 3.5 Sonnet 2024-10-22; Million Input Tokens 3 USD; Million Output tokens 15 USD

Comes to something in the range of 0.02-0.03 USD per code refactor request.
